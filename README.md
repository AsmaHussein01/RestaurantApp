Just Eat Takeaway- Early Career Mobile Engineering Program (IOS)-
Coding Assessment-

This solution aims to fetches and displays restaurant information using the Just Eat API.

This solution was built with- 
•	Swift, 
•	SwiftUI
•	Swift Playgrounds

This project was developed in Swift Playgrounds due to limited access to a Mac/Xcode environment. All core functionality and UI are present and working as intended. 

To run this app- 
1. Open Swift Playgrounds on iPad or Mac.
2. Create a new blank app.
3. Copy and paste all code from `Restaurant.swift` into the default file.
4. Press Run to launch the UI.

Potential Improvements-
If more time or tools were available, here are things I would improve:
- Improve UI with better layout and styling of restaurant cards
- Allow tapping on a restaurant for more info
- Display default restaurants on app launch instead of starting with an empty screen
